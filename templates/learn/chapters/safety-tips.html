    As a mobile money agent, you handle cash and digital money every day. Protecting yourself and your customers is essential for a sustainable business.
</p>

<h2>🔐 Secure Your Work Environment</h2>

<h3>Physical Security</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Position your workspace wisely</strong> - Keep your phone screen away from customer view during transactions</li>
    <li><strong>Secure your cash</strong> - Use a lockbox and count money discreetly</li>
    <li><strong>Be aware of your surroundings</strong> - Know your regular customers and watch for suspicious behavior</li>
    <li><strong>Limit cash on hand</strong> - Make regular bank deposits to reduce risk</li>
</ul>

<h3>Digital Security</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Never share your PIN</strong> - Not even with "network staff" calling you</li>
    <li><strong>Use strong passwords</strong> - Different passwords for each SIM/account</li>
    <li><strong>Enable screen lock</strong> - Auto-lock your phone after 30 seconds</li>
    <li><strong>Update your apps</strong> - Keep mobile money apps current for security patches</li>
</ul>

<h2>✅ Transaction Best Practices</h2>

<h3>Before Every Transaction</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Verify the customer's identity</strong> - Check ID for large amounts</li>
    <li><strong>Confirm the phone number</strong> - Read it back to the customer</li>
    <li><strong>Check the amount twice</strong> - Before pressing send</li>
    <li><strong>Verify your float balance</strong> - Ensure you have enough</li>
</ol>

<h3>After Every Transaction</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Wait for SMS confirmation</strong> - Both you and customer should receive it</li>
    <li><strong>Record immediately</strong> - Log in Floatly before the next customer</li>
    <li><strong>Give/take receipt</strong> - Keep records of every transaction</li>
</ol>

<h2>🚨 Emergency Preparedness</h2>

<h3>What to Do If Robbed</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stay calm</strong> - Your safety is more important than money</li>
    <li><strong>Don't resist</strong> - Comply with demands</li>
    <li><strong>Report immediately</strong> - Call police and your network provider</li>
    <li><strong>Block your lines</strong> - Contact MTN/Orange to freeze accounts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important Numbers to Save</h3>
